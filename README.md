# Yozora Redux - Xcode Color Theme

<img src="screenshot.png" width="75%" />

Yozora Redux is my own personally tailored variant of [Yozora](https://github.com/tursunovic/xcode-themes) that I use in [Xcode]. I've mostly just tweaked the sizing, some of the weighting, and the coloring to lean more towards Monokai, which was made famous in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

I've made this repo mainly so I keep track of this theme between Mac migrations, but to also freely offer it if anyone else is interested in using it. :)

## Installation

### Easiest Way

1. Install [ThemeInstaller](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/themeinstaller/id1148208665?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

3. Open `Yozora Redux.xccolortheme` with ThemeInstaller.
4. Restart Xcode if it is currently open.
5. In Xcode, go to `Preferences` > `Themes` and select `Yozora Redux` from the list of themes.
